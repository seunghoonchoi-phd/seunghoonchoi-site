# Homepage Work Rules

Follow the global user instructions first. These rules apply to this website repository.

## Incomplete Drafts

- When the user asks to put a homepage article, draft, or rough idea into `미완료`, create it under `content/<lang>/incomplete/`.
- Treat `미완료` as the owner's private draft shelf. Write the draft seriously and completely, but do not ask for a pre-publication review before committing.
- Use front matter with `hidden: true` and `reviewStatus: "none"` unless the user explicitly says otherwise.
- Fill the draft-list fields so the admin queue stays scannable when many drafts pile up: `title`, `date`, `draftSource` or `categories`, `subtitle`, `tags`, and `image` when a relevant existing image is available.
- After creating or updating a `미완료` draft, run the relevant Hugo build check, commit the scoped change, and push to `origin/main`.
- Do not move a `미완료` draft into a public section such as `column`, `career`, `apps`, `research`, `books`, or `literature` unless the user explicitly asks.

## RTL Layout Guard

- Arabic pages are RTL, but math/formula notation is LTR. Keep `.formula-block` content `direction:ltr` and visually centered.
- Do not center article-wide blocks with physical `margin-left:50%` plus `translateX(-50%)` unless an `html[dir="rtl"]` mirror rule is present. In RTL, mirror that centering with `margin-right:50%`, `margin-left:0`, and `translateX(50%)`.
- Do not hide skip links or screen-reader helpers with `left:-9999px`; in RTL pages that creates huge horizontal overflow. Use clipping (`clip-path:inset(50%)`) instead.
- After changing CSS, layout templates, Hugo language direction config, or Arabic content that contains wide blocks, run `node tools/check-rtl-layout.cjs` and `hugo --minify`.
- For visual changes touching Arabic pages, render and inspect `/ar/column/questions-lifeline/` or the affected Arabic page before publishing.
